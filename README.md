# Falco plugin Rust SDK

This is still a massive WIP. Still, feel free to look around (check out
e.g. [the sample plugins](falco_plugin/examples))
and check the [documentation](https://gnosek.github.io/falco-plugin-rs/), but it's probably too early
to depend on it for production plugins (wait at least until I publish it to crates.io :))
