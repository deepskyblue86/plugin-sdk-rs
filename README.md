# Falco plugin Rust SDK

This crate provides a framework for writing [Falco](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco)
plugins. There are several types of plugins available. Learn more about Falco plugins
and plugin types in the [Falco plugin documentation](https://falco.org/docs/plugins/).

This is still early days for the SDK. Feel free to look around (check out
e.g. [the sample plugins](falco_plugin/examples)) and check
the [documentation](https://gnosek.github.io/falco-plugin-rs/).

It's probably too early to depend on it for production plugins but please give it a try and report any issues
you may find.
